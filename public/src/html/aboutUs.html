                        Claire is a mom of 4 and married to Coach John Bird. She started running for fitness and mental health when the kids were young. To stay motivated she signed up for the Calgary Marathon and was hooked after that! As of writing this post (April 2023), Claire has ran 22 marathons!
                        <br><br>
                        Claire loves being in the mountains whether it be skiing, hiking, or backpacking with her family. Having a coach helps Claire balance her running goals and busy life for optimal success and fun. Claire is excited to join the WRTWC coaches roster so she can help others feel successful in their own running journey.
                        <br><br>
                        One of Claire's running resume highlights include getting her Abbott 6 Star medal in 2023 in Tokyo. She's no stranger to the marathon majors, as a result, having run Boston 3x. Her experience as an accomplished runner as well as someone who juggles a busy schedule is invaluable to anyone who has a hard time "fitting it all in" while tackling some big goals!

                        Brianne grew up participating in many sports including downhill ski racing, swimming, soccer, track, and cross country. She decided to take running more seriously in 2016 when she signed up for her first half marathon, just to see if she could do it.
                        <br><br>
                        Running has become a huge part of Brianne’s life. She has raced everything from 5k to 50k, some at the elite level. Notable accomplishments include running a 2:57 marathon at CIM, and finishing 4th female at the Calgary 50k ultra.
                        <br><br>
                        Brianne joined WRTWC as a coach so she can share her passion with others, and help people feel strong and accomplished. Brianne can often be found on the road or the trails, training with one of her four legged buddies.

                        Leslie is a busy mom of two who loves to spend her time travelling with her family. She has been running most of her life, growing up playing soccer, and then as a form of fitness in her teens and early twenties.
                        <br><br>
                        She ran her first 10km in 2013 but it wasn’t until she found group training and ran her first half-marathon in 2019 that she was truly hooked and needed this as a constant in her life. Flash forward a few years and she has since run over 30 races including 12 half Marathons and 3 Full Marathons (a distance she swore she would never run).
                        <br><br>
                        If she isn't busy talking about running and WRTWC, you can most definitely find her talking about Yoga, and the importance of recovery. She completed her 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training in 2021 and currently teaches a variety of yoga classes in Calgary.
                        <br><br>
                        Her passion is helping individuals who might feel intimidated in the fitness world to unlock their potential, whether that is signing up for a race or taking a group class. The time to finally “do the thing” is now.
